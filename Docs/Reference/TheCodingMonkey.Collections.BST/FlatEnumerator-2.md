# FlatEnumerator&lt;TKey,TValue&gt; class

Abstract base class for all BinarySearchTree enumerators. Implements an Enumerator for a Binary Search Tree by traversing the entire tree at Construction and flattening it according to the rules of the enumerator.

```csharp
public abstract class FlatEnumerator<TKey, TValue> : IEnumerator<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>
    where TKey : IComparable<TKey>
```
